                    - For fans of the show who know these characters,<br>
                    that's a welcome conclusion for a story we didn't even know we missed until Vince Gilligan showed it to us.<br> 
                    Even if it didn't necessarily need to exist, Breaking Bad may end up being enhanced by this in ways nobody<br>
                    ever expected.

                    - This is not just a romance film, it's so much more.<br>
                    The characters are amazingly developed and you fall in love with everyone really quickly. They are all silly<br>
                    but at the same time they are so delightful. I was amazed by how this film from 1999 is still relevant today.<br>
                    It definitely stands the test of time!
